### State Management
Product details are managed locally within the ProductDetail component. Global state for the user's cart ensures that cart contents are accessible application-wide.

### Error Handling

### Loading States
Indicates loading progress upon initially fetching product details. Handles potential delays gracefully, maintaining a good user experience.
