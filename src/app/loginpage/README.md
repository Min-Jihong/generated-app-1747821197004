This LoginForm component uses react-hook-form for form state management and validation, and a custom useAuth hook for authentication logic. It communicates login status and errors back to the user.


## Integration
### Data Flow
The LoginForm component collects user input and sends it to the authentication server. Upon successful login, the user is redirected to the Product Detail page. Error states and loading indicators are managed locally within the LoginForm.

### State Management
Local state within LoginForm manages the input data, loading state, and error messages. Global authentication state is managed outside this component, likely within a context or similar state management solution.

### Error Handling
LoginForm catches and displays error messages related to authentication or network issues. It also validates input fields to ensure they are not empty.

### Loading States
Shows a loading indicator within the login button during the authentication process, disabling further form submissions.
